          <h2>1. Working of Seed Drill Machine</h2>
          <p>A Seed Drill Machine is an advanced agricultural tool used to plant seeds in rows, at uniform depths, and with precise spacing. It ensures a faster and more efficient sowing process compared to manual methods, such as broadcasting. The key working principle of a seed drill is its ability to place seeds directly into the soil, creating furrows and covering them with soil, which improves germination rates and crop growth.</p>
          <ul class="list">
              <li><strong>Furrow Formation:</strong> The seed drill opens up a furrow in the soil using a rotating blade or coulter.</li>
              <li><strong>Seed Placement:</strong> Seeds are dropped into the furrow via seed tubes. The metering mechanism regulates the number of seeds dispensed per row.</li>
              <li><strong>Covering the Seed:</strong> After the seeds are placed, the soil is pushed back over the seeds to close the furrow, often using press wheels or other mechanisms.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This process ensures that the seeds are placed at a uniform depth, allowing for better root development and higher yield potential.</p>
