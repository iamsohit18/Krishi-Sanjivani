    <h1>üöú Water Pump ‚Äì Detailed Agricultural Overview</h1>
    <section class="section">
      <h2>‚úÖ 1. Working of Water Pump</h2>
      <p>
        An agricultural water pump is used to transfer water from natural or artificial sources to farmlands. These pumps enable farmers to irrigate large plots with precision, saving time and labor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Commonly used for borewell lifting, canal irrigation, and sprinkler setups, pumps can run on electric motors or fuel-based engines depending on availability and farm location.
      </p>
      <div class="extra">
        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <p>A 5 HP diesel pump can irrigate up to 3-4 acres in a single shift, depending on the water availability and head height.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="section">
      <h2>‚öôÔ∏è 2. Technical Components & Working</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Motor/Engine:</strong> Generates power to rotate the impeller. Common types: Electric, Diesel, Petrol.</li>
        <li><strong>Impeller:</strong> Rotating disc that creates centrifugal force to push water outward.</li>
        <li><strong>Pump Casing:</strong> Housing that directs the flow of water efficiently from suction to delivery.</li>
        <li><strong>Inlet/Outlet Pipes:</strong> Connected to the source and delivery areas respectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Suction Head:</strong> Distance between water level and pump inlet. Affects pump efficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Delivery Head:</strong> Vertical height the water must be lifted to reach the field.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="extra">
        <h3>Working Principle:</h3>
        <p>The motor rotates the impeller inside the pump casing. This creates low pressure (vacuum) at the inlet, causing water to be drawn in. The water gains velocity and pressure as it's pushed out through the outlet pipe.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="section">
      <h2>‚öíÔ∏è 3. How Does It Work?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pump is installed near or over the water source (groundwater, river, or storage tank).</li>
        <li>Power is supplied through electric grid or fuel combustion (diesel, petrol).</li>
        <li>As the motor starts, the impeller creates suction, drawing water through the inlet pipe.</li>
        <li>Water is forced out at high pressure through the outlet pipe towards the fields.</li>
        <li>The pump operates continuously or intermittently, depending on irrigation needs.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="extra">
        <h3>Note:</h3>
        <p>Proper priming (filling the pump with water) is essential before starting a centrifugal pump to avoid air blocks and dry running.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="section">
      <h2>üåæ 4. Main Uses of Water Pumps in Agriculture</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Efficient irrigation using flood, drip, or sprinkler systems.</li>
        <li>Refilling water tanks or reservoirs for later use.</li>
        <li>Boosting pressure in chemical sprayers (pesticide/fertilizer application).</li>
        <li>Lifting water from deep borewells up to 400 feet using submersible pumps.</li>
        <li>Removing excess water from waterlogged or flooded areas (drainage).</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="extra">
        <h3>Farmer Tip:</h3>
        <p>Use solar water pumps to reduce energy cost in areas with abundant sunlight and limited power access.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="section">
      <h2>üìå 5. Additional Info & Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose the right pump based on discharge requirement and head height.</li>
        <li>Check suction and delivery pipe size for optimal performance.</li>
        <li>Install foot valves to prevent backflow during shutoff.</li>
        <li>Clean filters and strainers regularly to prevent clogging.</li>
        <li>Overloading or dry running can damage the motor‚Äîinstall thermal overload protectors.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="extra">
        <h3>Fun Fact:</h3>
        <p>Modern IoT-based smart pumps can be controlled via mobile phones, enabling automation and water savings in large farms.</p>
